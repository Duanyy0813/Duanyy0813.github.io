Hello, I'm **Yangyang Duan**, currently pursuing my master's degree at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). My current research focuses on millimeter-wave radar localization and human activity sensing, and I am also interested in programming and sharing technology.

On this website, I will share my education and research experience, programming skills, and other interesting things. I hope to communicate with more people and learn from each other.

**Education:**
- 2025.09 - Now, Master of Electronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC)
- 2021.09 - 2025.06, Bachelor of Electronic Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology(HFUT)

**Project:**
- [UIE-DL](https://github.com/Duanyy0813/UIE-DL): a underwater image enhancement system based on deep learning.
- [mmWave-sensing](https://github.com/Duanyy0813/mmWave-sensing): a tutorial for mmWave sensing.
